# Advent of Code 2023
# ===================
In python.
Usually TDD, but sometimes if I'm in a hurry I do an experiment and don't look back if AoC tells me it's correct.

**I'm happy about any feedback on my solutions.**

# Setup
`python -m venv venv`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Run Tests
`pytest`

# Run Solution
Example for day one:
`cd aoc_1 && python aoc_1.py`
